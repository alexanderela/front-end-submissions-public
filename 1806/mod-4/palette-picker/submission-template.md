## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
Yes, I completed the base functionality. I did not complete the annotated server file, as I worked on the functionality until the night before the assignment was due, and I needed to rest for the upcoming week.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/alexanderela/palette-picker/blob/master/public/assets/happyCode.js)
I am proud of this code because I struggled with it for a long time and then resigned myself to asking someone for help. The next day I tried again and got it to work on my own. That was very gratifying, as I feared that this particular functionality would be very difficult to implement.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/alexanderela/palette-picker/blob/master/public/assets/sadCode.js)
I almost cried while trying to make this code work. I learned the hard way that .filter() can be difficult to make work with async await. I kept getting unresolved promises and not knowing why. It made me very sad.  I worked it out in the end though!

#### Link to Design Inspiration
